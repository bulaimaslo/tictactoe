# Tictactoe

## General info
A simple project whose main purpose was to remind me of java and revise the concept of OOP.
 
It allows to play Tic-tac-toe with bots of 3 difficulties:
 - easy - makes random moves
 - medium - able to find winning move and to block opponent's winning move
 - hard - impossible to win against. With my implementation of the minimax algorithm.
